<h2>According to [the] anarchist vision, any structure of hierarchy and authority carries a heavy burden of justification, whether it involves personal relations or a larger social order. If it cannot bear that burden - sometimes it can - then it is illegitimate and should be dismantled. When honestly posed and squarely faced, that challenge can rarely be sustained - Noam Chomsky</h2>

<body>
    <p>I have an associates degree in Political Science from Diablo Valley college. I am also at the University of California Davis for International Reltatons and National Security Studies. Part of my Political Science Experience is Focus on Geo Politics and Political Theory. Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time reading books based on History and Foreign Policy. In the winter, I am in overdrive activism because elections tend to come around this time. During the warmer months here in California, I enjoy soccer MMA ,volleyball, can not forget reading time :), and of course spending time with my beloved friends and family.
    
    When forced indoors, I follow a routine which can be learning new programming languages or my favorite is reading my books I typically read from 4 at a time they tend to be connected through history to give me a better understanding. As for fantasy, movies and television shows, I like star wars, regular show , and Youtube foreing Policy I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements and economic I listen to different professors and various voices.
